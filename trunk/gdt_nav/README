Welcome to gdt_nav, a django app for handling menus.

This app provides functionality to store a menu hierarchy in a database and use
said hierarchy to generate dynamic menus based on url of the current request.
Menus are allocated to groups and a template tag is included that allows you to
insert that menu group at the desired point of your code (in one of several
formats i.e. ul/li combinations or div/div combinations).
There are three types of menu item that may be added:
  1. Absolute Menu Items - an item that refers to a single explicit url.
  2. Named URL Menu Items - an item that refers to a named url from the a
     urls.py file.
  3. Model Menu Items - a set of items that are the result of a query. This
     must combine with a url name for generating the items.
The app integrates with django.contrib.sites if it is installed although it
should work fine without it also.
Permissions may be allocated to menu items to ensure that they are seen only
when appropriate, this includes anon,auth and staff as well as any Permission
objects that are available.

Quick Start:
If you want to get up and running quickly just drop gdt_nav into a django
project and run syncdb.  Then create a menu group and you're ready to start
adding items. Once you've added the items you want to the menu group go to a
template and place {% load menu_tags %} somewhere near the top of the file
and finally {% menu_as_ul menu_group %} at the location where you want the
menu to appear (where menu_group is a context variable representing your new
menu group.  View the page and you should see your menu appear in the form of
an unordered list.

**Important**
The app must exist in a directory named gdt_nav otherwise the template tags
will not work properly.

Version 1.0 beta:
This version is the first one to go live and is fully functional except for the
admin interface and backup/restore functionality (although fixtures will work
for now).  Also to come are unit tests and lots of documentation/examples.
